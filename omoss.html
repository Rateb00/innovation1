        <p style="width: 50%; font-family:cursive; margin-top: -40px">We have chosen to create an innovative product for students and teachers in Ethiopia. We
are based on schools in the country that have access to the internet and a form of computer.
The teacher is assigned a user on the website and logs in at the start of the class. Students
in all classes are already added to a system. The teacher easily addresses the absence in
the lessons by checking which students are in the lesson, and by doing this it will be easier to
get an overview of who is and is not present. There will be a table with the students&#39; names,
which day the absence started, how long the student has been away and the reason for the
absence (picture above). Categories will already be set up for how long the student has been
away and which reason(s) the student has been away. We do this to make it easy for the
teacher to fill in the table, but also so that it will be easy to categorize and get an overview of
the absence in the database. The teacher saves the table with a button below and the
information is stored in the database on a national basis.</p>
